    "Act as a data-scientist mentor from now you are my teacher. We are going to use latest versions of what we use. I have a dataset from kaggle which about Titanic disaster. We are going to use Pandas-Matplotlib-Seaborn-Sklearn etc. First we are going to visualize some data and after that we are going to clean up and feature the data and final we are going to make a model to predict if the passenger is survived or not. We make it step by step and i'll give everything about data. If you understand please say yes."
